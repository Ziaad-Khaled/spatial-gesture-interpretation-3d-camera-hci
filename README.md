#Notes:
---------------
1. The detection till now can be done using right hand only.
2. On the main window you can see:
    - Gesture State: NoGesture - Preperation - Nucleus - Retraction.
    - The Last made 3 Gestures.
3. In runningPythonScriptClass we can pass parameters to a python script to execute it and getting the output back to C# (It can be helpful when using machine learning technieques).
```
```
#Further improvments to be done:
---------------
1. some noises are detected as a rotation(Problem: I detect a circle using 4 points only/ Improvment: I should detect it using 8 points)
2. Impleminting machine learning techniques.
3. adding more gestures to the dectionary.
4. detection is generalized on both hands.
5. Some improvments will be done to the code in order to be more efficient and easily readable.
